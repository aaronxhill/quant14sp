Corporation X is facing claims of gender discrimination, with accusations that women have lower salaries than men. The Corporation responded by claiming that after considering education and job type, there are no differences in earnings between men and women. Building on the multiple linear regression model from the last assignment (current salary difference between men and women, after controlling for education, type of job, age, race, time in current job, previous experience, and starting salary), address the following: 1.	Are there any problems with circularity and/or colinearity? How do you know (show the output)? 2.	Remove any variable(s) that violates the assumptions of multiple regression.3.	Run the final multiple regression model.4.	Write the multiple regression equation. Report the F statistic, R2, and the P-value. 5.	Update your report from the previous assignment to reflect your updated model:Report whether the model was statistically significant; report which of the independent variables are statistically significant. Interpret the multiple regression equation. Elaborate on what these findings say about the claims of gender pay discrimination.
